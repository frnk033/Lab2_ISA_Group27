The syn_script_1 is the script used to synthesize the FPmul leaving Design Compiler free to choose the significands multiplier implementation (flatten hierarchy).

The syn_script_2 is the script used to synthesize the FPmul forcing Design Compiler to implement the the significands multiplier with a CSA multiplier.

The syn_script_3 is the script used to synthesize the FPmul forcing Design Compiler to implement the the significands multiplier with a PPARCH multiplier.

The syn_script_4 is the script used to synthesize the FPmul using the optimize_registers + compile commands.

The syn_script_5 is the script used to synthesize the FPmul using the compile_ultra command.
